There are 4 demos in the BayesPI2 toolbox (run_demos_1, run_demos_2, run_demos_3, and run_demos_4). The description of parameters (e.g. number of alpha hyperparameters classes) are stated in the above mentioned four demos. All input demo datasets are available in demo_in, and the output results will be saved in demo_out. At present, the toolbox only works for data with small sample size (e.g. maximum 1000 genes and sequence length less than 1kb) but user can change these default parameters in read_seq_fa.m. Please note that the complied c codes only work on Linux and window PC machine.

There are still bugs in the program but I will fix them in my spare time.
